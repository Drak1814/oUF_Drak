# oUF_Drak

###This is a oUF Layout that does NOT replace the stock Blizzard player/target/focus/pet unit frames. It is intended to be used as a HUD that only appears while in combat.

**NOTE: ALL FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE OCCURING AT: [VisiHUD](https://github.com/Drak1814/VisiHUD "https://github.com/Drak1814/VisiHUD")**

Features include aura filtering, threat highlighting, display of all secondary resources, cast bars for player/pet/target, and combat feedback text. Mouse over the frames for more detailed health and power text. Some elements auto-adjust based on role (healer, tank, damage).

**Does not require oUF Core to be installed**

**Recomended:** [oUF Smooth Update](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info11503-oUFSmoothUpdate.html "http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info11503-oUFSmoothUpdate.html"), [oUF SpellRange](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12839-oUFSpellRange.html "http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12839-oUFSpellRange.html")
